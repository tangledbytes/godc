# GODC

GODC (pronounced as: Godessy) stands for Golang Data Structures - Concurrent. This is a collection of data structures that are thread safe and mostly lock-free and wait-free. These implementations mostly are not my own creation rather adapted from OpenJDK or The Art of Multiprocessor Programming Book.
